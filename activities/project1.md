# Project 1 
#### To be completed on  and by the end of the day Oct 31st, 2023.

There are two phases, part 1 which is done individually and part 2 to be completed as a group project (four groups: A, B, C, D). Your group number (and paper assignment for part 1) will be made available to you via Slack on Oct 30th, 2023.

For this project you will gain experience with the Who, What, How framework by conducting a "review" of 17 abstracts for papers that were accepted in the early cycle at the flagship conference in software engineering for 2024. See 
[ICSE 2024 early cycle accepted papers for the technical track] (https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2024/icse-2024-research-track). 

#### Preparation

Before starting this project, you should read the papers referenced below indicated as assigned readings. You may also wish to read the optional readings and refer to the lecture slides/video. 

### Part 1

The first part is done individually and is due by **3pm on Tuesday, Oct 31st.** Submission instructions can be found below.

Your goal is to apply the Who, What, How framework to your assigned papers by answering the following questions: 
- who are the claimed **beneficiaries** of the reported research, that is by the authors (see the WWH framework);
- what kinds of **knowledge** are captured in these papers in terms of descriptive or prescriptive knowledge (see our reading/lecture on Design Science);
- which empirical **research methods** (if any) are used in the papers and how do the methods used meet the quality criteria of **generalizability, control, precision and realism** (see readings by McGrath and the WWH framework and our lecture slides on this topic), or is the research non empirical (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empirical_evidence)
- which **software engineering topics** do these papers cover (according to the topics specified by [Swebok](https://cs.fit.edu/~kgallagher/Schtick/Serious/SWEBOKv3.pdf) and also discussed in the Lenberg systematic mapping paper);
- for the empirical papers, how do the authors convince the readers that their research and findings are **novel, rigorous, and relevant** to others (see Design science paper and lecture slides on Design Science);
- what is your personal opinion of the **importance** of this research.

Your task is to read and think critically about each of the assigned paper abstracts, and answer the above set of questions for each of them (some papers may have a preprint online, and you are free and encouraged to look at these if available). Some of these questions may be difficult to answer -- do your best attempt and in some cases you can indicate if the answer is just not clear.   

Note that several of the questions ask you to elaborate on your decisions for type of paper etc, for many of these you can copy/paste quotes directly from the paper abstracts you are reading.

#### Submission instructions
To submit your individual answers for each assigned paper, please use this form: https://www.surveymonkey.ca/r/emse-zurich-proj1-part1 for each of your 17 assigned paper abstracts.
Make sure you fill out the corresponding form for each paper (that is, take care to select the paper name carefully in the survey pulldown box!!!!). You may wish to record your answers separately before entering in survey monkey in case of mistakes.

### Part  2

Each paper abstract will have approximately three or four "reviewers" assigned to it.  In the second phase, you will compare your answers with others in your group (A, B, C or D) that will also have reviewed the same abstracts. You can access all the answers submitted by way of a spreadsheet (that will be shared with you via Slack on Tuesday Oct 31st 2023 after 3pm). 

#### Submission instructions
For this second phase, you should compare your "answers" to other participants in the class for the same set of papers and discuss/report/note any discrepancies with other members in your group. For each paper, submit a new response that represents your "combined" view here: https://www.surveymonkey.ca/r/emse-zurich-proj1-part2 by end of the day Oct 31st. Budget your time accordingly - and try to get through most of the papers.  

For the report back in class, your group should prepare a very brief presentation on your findings from this activity.  Tell us when you agreed and disagreed, and reflect on the Who, What, How framework as a way for reviewing the papers.  
If you have previously reviewed papers for conferences, how did this experience compare with this previous reviewing experience?  Each group will have up to 10 minutes to present their insights.  Post any presentation materials on Slack (use the channel Project1 and label your file with the group letter A, B, C or D).
