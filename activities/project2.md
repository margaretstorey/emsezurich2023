# Project 2 
#### To be completed on and by the end of the day Thursday Nov 2nd, 2023.

This project will be done in groups of three-four students (five groups overall, group members will be assigned).

For this project you will gain experience designing a mixed methods (or multi method) study for a "fictional" research project of your own design. At least one of the methods in your design should be a qualitative method.  

#### Preparation

Before starting this project, you should read the slides and assigned papers posted on qualitative methods and mixed/multi methods, and refer to the slides on "formulating good research questions", as well as the slides on "conducting disruptive research". 

#### Instructions

Your goal is to design the methodology for an exciting "fictional" project to study the impacts of a disruptive new technology (an existing one or one you may invent as part of this research) that can be used in software engineering (or a related field).  For this research project, you will need to use a mixed or multi methods design, where at least one method is qualitative and inductive, and involves the direct involvement of human subjects (refer back to the WWH framework paper and to the slides that show a playbook for conducting disruptive research in software engineering).

To design this **research project**, first you need to consider and report the following: 
- What **disruptive technology** are you investigating and why? Which **tasks** will this technology support?
- Using McLuhan's tetrad, consider how this new technology could **enhance human capabilities**, **retrieve features or characteristics** from a previous technology, make **obsolete** some technology used before, and finally what the technology may **reverse into** (or flip into) if overused?

To refine your **research question(s)**, you need to report and consider:
- What **phenomena** (unit(s) of analysis or actors) you will study and what **theoretical ideas** (concepts) you have about these phenomena (see the McGrath paper)? Note: Combining these with the dimensions of the tetrad will help you brainstorm on a matrix of possible questions.  Select at least two of these questions, choosing questions that were inspired by two or more of the four tetrad dimensions. 

Why this **research matters** and to whom? 
- Consider who are the claimed **beneficiaries** of your proposed research (see the WWH framework);
- Thinking of the beneficiary, why is this **question important** to answer (that is consider, the **relevance** of your proposed research)?

What kinds of **knowledge** will you create?
- Consider what kind of **theoretical knowledge** you are aiming to create (in terms of descriptive or prescriptive theoretical knowledge, see our reading/lecture on Design Science); how will your research findings or results contribute to what is already known (that is think about the **novely** of your proposed research and how you will add to or form new theoretical knowledge)? 

What **methods** will you use?
- Consider and justify which empirical **research methods** you will use as part of the mixed or multi method design.  Why did you select these methods, how do they align with your research questions (see WWH and McGrath papers, and the slides on mixed methods)? 
- How do the methods selected align with the quality criteria of **generalizability, control, precision and realism** (see readings by McGrath and the WWH framework and our lecture slides on this topic).
- Report how you will ensure the methods you will use are conducted in a **rigorous** manner. 
- Consider and report the main **threats to validity or limitations** of your research. 
- Given that your research will involve human participants, consider and report how you will ensure the research is conducted ethically. 

#### Submission instructions
Prepare a google slides presentation to present your study idea and design to the rest of the class.  You will have up to 10 minutes to present your research design.  Post the link to your slides in Slack (use the channel called Project 2). These will be presented on Friday morning, Nov 3rd at 9am.
