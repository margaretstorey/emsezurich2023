# Project 2 
#### To be completed on and by the end of the day Nov 2nd, 2023.

** work in progress!**

This project can be done in groups of up to three students.  
Try to work with students you did not work with for project 1 and also choose people you may not know that well! 

For this project you will gain experience designing a mixed methods (or multi) study for a "fictional" research project of your own choosing. At least one of the methods should be a qualitative method.  

#### Preparation

Before starting this project, you should read the slides and assigned papers posted on qualitative methods and mixed/multi methods. 

#### Instructions

Your goal is to design the methodology for a "fictional" (or potentially in progress research) project where you use a mixed or multi methods design, and at least one method is qualitative/inductive and involves the direct involvement of human subjects (refer back to the WWH framework paper). 

Prepare a presentation of the methodology, stating: 
- who are the claimed **beneficiaries** of your proposed research (see the WWH framework);
- what is your main **research question** of your proposed research?  Thinking of the beneficiary, why is this **question important** to answer (that is consider the **relevance** of your proposed research)? 
- what kind of **theoretical knowledge** are you aiming to create (in terms of descriptive or prescriptive theoretical knowledge, see our reading/lecture on Design Science); how will your research findings or results contribute to what is already known (that is think about the **novely** of your proposed research)? 
- which empirical **research methods** will you use as part of the mixed or multi method design?  Why did you select these methods, how do they align with your research questions? 
- How do the methods selected align with the quality criteria of **generalizability, control, precision and realism** (see readings by McGrath and the WWH framework and our lecture slides on this topic).
- how will you ensure the methods you will use are conducted in a **rigorous** manner? What will the main **threats to validity or limitations** be of your research that you will need to report? 
- given that your research will involve human participants, how will ensure that your research is conducted **ethically**? 

#### Submission instructions
Prepare a google slides presentation to present to the rest of the class.  You will have 10 minutes to present your research design.  Post the link to your slides in Slack (see the channel called Project 2).
