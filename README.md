# EMSE Zurich 2023 

Empirical software engineering is a research area concerned with the study of software engineering processes and artifacts, with the goal to understand and improve software engineering tools, processes, culture and software quality. This topic is of relevance to researchers, practitioners and the users of software systems. This course will prepare PhD students for advanced research in industrial and academic settings by examining how to plan, conduct and report on empirical investigations of software engineering phenomena. The course will cover techniques applicable to each of the steps of an empirical software engineering research project, including formulating and identifying relevant research questions, data analysis (with a focus on qualitative and mixed methods), building evidence, developing new and refining existing theories, assessing validity and novelty of the research methods and outcomes, and publishing and presenting findings to different audiences. The course will emphasize research methods that are used to study human interactions with software engineering methods and tools.
We will explore, understand and critique the methods used in several examples of studies of software engineering methodologies and tools used in industry, and through academic peer reviewed articles published in empirical software engineering venues.

This week long will have three full days of lectures (Monday/Wednesday/Friday), punctuated by two days (Tuesday/Thursday) of time for student reading and exercises to deepen insights on the material explored in this course.  Students will report back on their exercises during the final two lecture days (Wednesday and Friday).
