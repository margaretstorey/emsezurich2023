### Description
Empirical software engineering is a research area concerned with the study of software engineering processes and artifacts, with the goal to understand and improve software engineering tools, processes, culture and software quality. This topic is of relevance to researchers, practitioners and the users of software systems across many domains. This course will prepare PhD students for advanced research in industrial and academic settings by examining how to plan, conduct and report on empirical investigations of software engineering and other computing or interdisciplinary phenomena. The course will cover techniques applicable to each of the steps of an empirical research project, including formulating and identifying relevant research questions, data analysis (with a focus on qualitative and mixed methods), building evidence, developing new and refining existing theories, assessing validity and novelty of the research methods and outcomes, and publishing and presenting findings to different audiences. The course will emphasize research methods that are used to study human interactions with software engineering methods and tools but the insights are applicable to other domains in computing.

We will explore, understand and critique the methods used in several examples of studies of software engineering methodologies and tools used in industry, and through academic peer reviewed articles published in empirical software engineering venues.

This week long course will have three full intense days of lectures and discussions (Monday/Wednesday/Friday), punctuated by two days (Tuesday/Thursday) for student reading and projects to deepen insights on the material explored during the lectures.  Students will report back on their projects and readings during the final two lecture days (Wednesday and Friday).
